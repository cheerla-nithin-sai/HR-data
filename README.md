# EMPOWERING HR USING ML MODEL END TO END PROJECT
### Overview
#### This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts employee attrition based on HR analytics data. The application is built using Python, Streamlit for deployment, and scikit-learn for machine learning.

### Features
#### Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and scales numerical data.
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes key insights from HR data.
#### Feature Engineering: Adds interaction features to improve model performance.
#### Model Training: Uses Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest Classifiers.
#### Performance Evaluation: Measures accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
#### Streamlit Deployment: Provides an interactive web-based UI for data analysis and model training.
